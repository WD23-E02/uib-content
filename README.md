## Objectives

- Create simple pages using only HTML
- Explain the structure of an HTML Document

## Three ways to include CSS

1. Inline styling. This is done by adding a style attribute to an HTML tag. We will see shortly that this can have some unintended consequences.

2. <style></style>. This is done by using a style tag and placing CSS inside of it.

3 . External stylesheets. This is the most common way and almost always the best practice

## How to write CSS styles

4 ways to target styling HTML content;

1. The tag or the markup - `h1`

   Will target ALL tags of the same type

2. Classes - `.highlight`

   Precise way to target 1 or more elements with the same styles

3. IDs

## How to construct a style

- All style rules must be contained within curly braces

{ }

We call this the style declaration

- All style declarations must start with a selector

For example; `h1`
